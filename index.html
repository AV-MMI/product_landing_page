			<p>Different religions have varying stances on the use of cannabis, historically and presently. <span class="text_highlight">In ancient history some religions used cannabis as an entheogen, particularly in the Indian subcontinent where the tradition continues on a more limited basis.</span></p>

			<p>During the Hindu festival of Holi, people consume bhang which contains cannabis flowers. According to one description, when the amrita (elixir of life) was produced from the churning of the ocean by the devas and the asuras as described in the Samudra manthan, <span class="text_highlight">Shiva created cannabis from his own body to purify the elixir</span> (whence, for cannabis, the epithet angaja or "body-born"). Another account suggests that the cannabis plant sprang up when a drop of the elixir dropped on the ground. Thus, cannabis is used by sages due to association with elixir and Shiva. </p>

			<p>Cannabis is a unique drug. While heroin is an opioid and cocaine is a stimulant, marijuana <span class="text_highlight">doesnâ€™t cleanly fit into a particular category of drugs.</span> Marijuana can depress, excite and impair the central nervous system. This makes it difficult to classify. </p>

			<p>Marijuana is largely viewed as a depressant because it slows down messages that travel between the body and brain. It can calm nerves, relax tense muscles and lower inhibitions. Prescription depressants fall into three categories: barbiturates, benzodiazepines and sedative-hypnotics. These drugs depress the central nervous system. Physicians often prescribe depressants to individuals experiencing anxiety or sleep problems.</p>

			<h2 id="why-illegal" class="titles">Why is it illegal?</h2>
			<p>Under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, marijuana is classified as a Schedule I drug on the basis that it is perceived as addictive, with "a high potential for abuse." This classification comes from the suspicion that people who use marijuana get hooked, become "potheads," and lead lives dominated by the drug. Some users do become addicted to cannabis, but many don't. The same happens with alcohol, which is perfectly legal.</p>

			<p>In order to fight this argument for prohibition, legalization advocates have asserted that <span class="text_highlight">marijuana is not as addictive as government sources claim.</span> So how addictive is marijuana really? The truth is that we just don't know, <span class="text_highlight">but the risk appears to be relatively low, especially when compared to other drugs.</span>
